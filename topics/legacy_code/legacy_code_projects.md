# Legacy code project under current active devlopment

All are implemented as web apps using the [Spring/React](/topics/spring_react/) stack with Google OAuth login.

* [Courses](/topics/legacy_code/proj_courses)
  - Provides various ways to search data related to courses offered at UC Santa Barbara
  - Repo: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-courses>
  - Running app: <https://courses.dokku-00.cs.ucsb.edu>

* [Gauchoride](/topics/legacy_code/proj_gauchoride)
  - When it goes live, this app will allow UC Santa Barbara students that qualify for transportation assistance due to physical disabilities to reserve rides on golf carts provided by
    the Division of Student Affairs.
    The program is coordinated by the [Office of Veterans and Military Services](https://veterans.sa.ucsb.edu/), however students do not need to be
    Veterans or have a connection to the US Military to be eligible; eligibility is determined in coorination with the [Disabled Students Program](https://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/).
  - Repo: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-gauchoride>
  - Running app: <https://gauchoride.dokku-00.cs.ucsb.edu>

* [HappyCows](/topics/legacy_code/proj_happycows)
  - Simulation game to explore the "Tragedy of the Commons", used in CHEM 123 (Environmental Chemistry) at UC Santa Barbara
  - Repo for code: <https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/proj-happycows>
  - Running app: <https://happycows.dokku-00.cs.ucsb.edu>

* [Organic](/topics/legacy_code/proj_organic)
  - When an MVC is completed, this project will be replacement to the [ucsb-cs-github-linker](https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com) app (currently in Ruby on Rails) in Spring/React (the CMPSC 156 tech stack).
  - The current  ucsb-cs-github-linker is used in a variety of courses at UCSB to enable instructors to invite students to a github organization automatically from a UCSB course roster.
  - The current ucsb-cs-github-linker also allows instructors to:
    - maintain the link between a students github id and their UCSB perm, email and name
    - automatically create repos with the correct permissions for assignments, either individual or team repos.
    - However, the code base is difficult to maintain, because few students knowRuby on Rails.  It is very hard to onboard new students to this tech stack (it can take two weeks just to on board someone to the point of being able to run the application in dev mode).

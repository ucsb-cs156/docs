Google OAuth requires that applications (other than those running on localhost) use `https` to encrypt the traffic that goes over the network.

Here's how to enable https on Dokku apps.  Throughout, we'll use <tt><b><i>app-name</i></b></tt> for the name of your app; be sure to
substitute in <tt><b><i>jpa03-cgaucho</i></b></tt>, for example.

1. On your assigned dokku machine, at the prompt, type these two commands, substituting in your UCSB email in place of `cgaucho@ucsb.edu`

   *  <tt>dokku letsencrypt:set <b><i>app-name</i></b> email <b><i>cgaucho@ucsb.edu</i></b></tt>
   *  <tt>dokku letsencrypt:enable <b><i>app-name</i></b></tt>

Video Courses:

* [React JS Masterclass - Go From Zero To Job Ready (34 hours)](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/react-js-masterclass/9781805125549/)
  - I suggest that if you use this resources, don't necessarily expect to do all 34 hours!
  - Instead, use it to help you get past the point of being "lost in the syntax"
  - A few good videos to start with:
    - [React Behind the Scenes (11m34s)](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/react-js-masterclass/9781805125549/9781805125549-video2_4/)
    - [JSX: In-Depth Introduction (12m11s)](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/react-js-masterclass/9781805125549/9781805125549-video2_7/)
    - [Why We Need States? (10m2s](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/react-js-masterclass/9781805125549/9781805125549-video3_1/)

# React Naming Conventions

# Linting your react code

To check your code for style issues, you can use `eslint`.

Install it with `npm install eslint --save-dev` then run this command, where `directory` is a directory containing
your React code:

```
npx eslint directory
```

Be careful that you don't run eslint on code in a `build` directory (i.e. the generated JavaScript); you only want to run it on your JavaScript source code.

If you get the error:

```
Error: Failed to load parser '@typescript-eslint/parser'...
```

then, try installing `typescript` manually:

```
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

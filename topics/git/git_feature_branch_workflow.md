This article describes a more advanced workflow than the [Git: Basic Workflow](/topics/git_basic_workflow/) where all work is done on the `main` branch.

You should be completely comfortable with the [Git: Basic Workflow](/topics/git_basic_workflow/) before diving into this more advanced topic.

# A quick refresher: create a new branch off `main`

If you are already familiar with this topic, here's a brief refresher on how to create a new feature branch.  If this is your first time reading about this topic, don't worry if this doesn't entirely make sense yet.

To create a new feature branch, first decide on a name for your branch, e.g. `4pm-3-sortCoursesByQtr`.  We'll just call the new branch `4pm-3-newBranch`

```
git status
git fetch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b newBranch
```

An explanation of each of these comamnds:

| Command | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| `git status` | Be sure there is no unsaved work; if so, deal with it first. |
| `git fetch` | Update all of the local branch information in your repo |
| `git checkout main` | Put your repo on the `main` branch |
| `git pull origin main` | Update the local `main` branch to be synced with the `main` branch on the `origin` remote (i.e. GitHub) |
| `git checkout -b newBranch` | Create a new branch called `newbranch` that starts out pointing to the same commit as `main` |

# A workflow based on feature branches

In most "real-world" uses of git/github (e.g. at software companies), rather than working on the `master` branch being the common case,
it is far more often the case that you *never, ever, ever work directly on master!!!*

Instead, each time you start a new story, issue, feature or bug fix, you start by creating a "feature branch" as an alternative to the `master` branch.

When you are finished with the story, feature, bug fix, etc. you would do a pull request from the feature branch
to the `master` branch.  This could be a pull request within the same repository, or it could be a pull request from one fork of a repo to another.

# Using this workflow 

You will use this branch method to avoid accidentally making changes to pending/open pull requests while working on other issues. That might happen when you do all your work on master because pull requests don't use a snapshot of the code from the time that you made the pull request; instead, they point to the branch you are trying to pull from. This means if you push more changes to a branch after making a pull request from that branch, these changes will be reflected in the pull request immediately. And the goal here is to submit each issue you resolve in a separate pull request.

Every pull request should be from a feature branch.

This will also show you how many teams develop software **in the real
world**. In these environments, you **never, ever, ever** make changes
directly to the master branch. Master is for **production-ready
code**. Devvelopment teams use branches to keep in-development
projects/pieces separate.

# How to

When beginning work on an issue, you should start clean from the master version. `git status` will tell you which branch you are on. If you are not on master, switch to master with `git checkout master` (your changes on the other branch will not be lost; they will still be there if you `git checkout` back to that branch). Make sure you are up-to-date by calling `git pull`, then create a new branch with `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`.

It is a good practice to start your branch name with the name
of your team, followed by a hyphen and then a brief description
of the feature you are working on.

```
$ git checkout -b teamName-text-color
Switched to a new branch 'teamName-text-color'
$
```

The `-b` means to create a new branch; if you are switching to an existing branch, you can just leave off the `-b`. 

As you work on this branch, you will use:

* `git push origin teamName-text-color` rather than `git push origin master`
* `git pull origin teamName-text-color` rather than `git pull origin master`

After you've committed all your changes on this feature branch, push it, and then open a new pull request repo from the branch you were working on and include the issue in the pull request description.

# More detail about creating feature branches

When starting a new PR, you should typically start with a new branch off of main.  Remember to get a fresh copy of main:

## Normal flow: fresh copy of main

```
git fetch 
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```
The only exception would be when your work builds on work that's in a branch that hasn't been merged to main yet. In this case, you may need to branch off an older branch.  However, it is important that you either (a) rebase that branch on main, or (b) merge in the code from main.
Here's what each of those options looks like:

## (a) branch-off-branch, rebasing on main

Always prefer rebasing if it doesn't result in a messy merge conflict;
it leaves the git history cleaner and easier to understand:

```
git checkout old-branch
git pull origin old-branch
git checkout -b new-branch
git pull --rebase origin main
```

At this stage if all is well, proceed with force pushing the rebased new-branch

```
git push origin new-branch -f
```

But If you get a ton of merge conflicts, then do this
```
git rebase --abort
```
and start over with the merging in main (option (b) below).

## (b) branch-off-branch, merging in main

This technique results in a "messier" git history, but is less likely to lead to merge conflicts,
so use it as a backup option:

```
git checkout old-branch
git pull origin old-branch
git checkout -b new-branch
git fetch
git merge origin/main
git push origin new-branch
```

A common problem in web development is that you may want to separate out development of the frontend and backend components, and work on them in parallel.
But it can be difficult to develop these parts in isolation.  This is where tools such as Swagger (for the backend) and Storybook (for the frontend) can be of help.

Storybook provides a way to construct a visual catalog of your React components and try them out with different inputs (props).

It can serve as both documentation, and a way to prototype, demonstrate, and interactively test React components in isolation from the 
rest of your web application.

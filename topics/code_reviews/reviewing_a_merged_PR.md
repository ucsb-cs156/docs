# {{page.title}}

It is unusual to do a code review on a PR that has already been merged.  

However, there are times during the *course* when, as an exercise, a student may need to do a code review to satisfy the requirements of an assignment,
and there are no open pull requests to review.  In that case, here is a workaround: you can do a review on a merged PR. It looks a little different from the
normal workflow though, so this page exists to show what that looks like.

Steps: 
1. Navigate to the PR
2. Select the `Files Changed` tab.
3. Click the `Review Changes` button at right.
4. Write a comment in the box, e.g. `LGTM` or `I wonder if it would have been better to do it this way ... (explanation goes here)`
5. Click `Submit`

This animation shows what that looks like:


And here's what that looks like in the timeline of the PR:

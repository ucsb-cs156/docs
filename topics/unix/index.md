An understanding of how to use the Unix operating system has emerged as a fundamental computing skill.

* Linux (a variety of Unix) is the operating system that is used on the machines in Phelps 3525 and the CSIL lab.
* Linux is the basis of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
* MacOS is a variant of BSD Unix

Most of what we'll be using related to Unix/Linux in this course actually pertains to command line tools that you access from the bash shell.    This includes commands such as `ls`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, etc.

While these commands are associated with Unix, because they originally appeared on Unix systems, in fact, they have been ported to many other systems as well.  Cygwin is a package for Windows that allows users to run many programs associated with Unix on Windows systems.

You can also get many of these tools by using a bash shell for Windows such as the *git bash shell* that comes with *Git for Windows*, or the bash shell that is being provided with Windows 10.

## Learning Basic Unix Commands

* [This video tutorial by Ryan He](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzQXJZpvpSRrSndPZwfqqkrBCmXq?projector=1) was developed under the supervision of Prof. Ziad Matni, and is a nice introduction to basic Unix commands if you need a refresher, or if you are joining CS156 as a transfer student from a school where Unix was not used.

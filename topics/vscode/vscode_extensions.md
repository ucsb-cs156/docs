There are *extensions* for VSCode that add extra functionalilty for particular programming languages, frameworks, etc.

In this article, we describe how to install extensions, as well as provide a list of the extensions that staff and students have found useful for this course.

## How to install extensions

We'll demonstrate how to install extensions by installing one that every student in this class should install: the "Extension Pack for Java" from Microsoft.

To install extensions in VSCode, start by clicking the ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b2fdb6f-8973-432e-a50c-a27493a42e66) icon in the left navigaton panel; that should bring
up an interface like this one:

Next, in the upper search box, type in `Java`.  This should do a search on extensions that are applicable to Java.  The screen should then look like this:

The top result, or at least one of the top results, should be "Extension Pack for Java" from Microsoft.  Click the blue install button next to this extension. That should make your
screen look like this:

Eventually the *installing* will change to *installed*, like this:

Note that installing the "Extension Pack for Java" from Microsoft *automatically installs several other extensions*, including, but not limited to:
* "Debugger for Java" by Microsoft
* "Intellicode" by Microsoft
* "Maven for Java" by Microsoft
* "Language Support for Java(TM) by RedHat"
* ... and a few others.

You can see which extensions are installed by removing any text from the extensions search field, and then separating the "INSTALLED" and "POPULAR" panes:

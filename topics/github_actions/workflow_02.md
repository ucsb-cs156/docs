# {{page.title}} - {{page.description}}

Workflow `02-gh-pages-rebuild-part-1.yml` consists of three parts:

* An introductory job called `Build Basic Site`
* Six jobs that rebuild the gh-pages site for the main branch, and run in parallel
* A matrix of six jobs that rebuild the gh-pages site for each PR, and also run in parallel

Here's what that looks like when running with exactly one active PR.  If there were multiple active PRs, the second set of six jobs would be repeated as many times as there are PRs:

## Uploading Artifacts

The workflow [`actions/upload-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) is used in various places to upload artifacts that are then downloaded and deployed to the
gh-pages branch in the workflow `04-gh-pages-rebuild-part-2.yml`.

Here's an example:

```yml
    - name: Upload to artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
          name: javadoc
          path: ${{ env.destination }}
          overwrite: true
```

Here:
* `name` is a key used for the key/value store used by Github Actions for artifacts
* `path` is the location that the artifact should be retrieved from.  When it is described by a variable `${{ env.destination }}` it is because a *previous* step used that as the destination to store something (e.g. the generated javadoc, coverage report, etc.).
* `overwrite: true` is needed because the `actions/upload-artifact`, by default, will not overwrite a previously uploaded artifact.

The names currently used in the script are:

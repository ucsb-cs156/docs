# {{page.title}} - {{page.description}}

The workflow {{page.wf82}} was written by Ahsun Tariq as part of his research into the impact of reflection on Software Engineering Education.  Phill Conrad also made
contributions.

The purpose of the workflow is to provide the team with a summary of the state of the Kanban board at periodic intervals, showing the number of issues each team member has
in the various columns of the Kanban board.

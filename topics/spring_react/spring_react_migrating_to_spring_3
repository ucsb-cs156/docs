## {{page.description}}

All of the Spring/React legacy code apps used in CMPSC 156 that were started in S24 or earlier used Spring 2.

At a certain point, it became imperative to move to Spring 3 because some of the dependencies of the old stack had security vulnerabilities, and the updated versions that fixed the vulnerabilities only worked with Spring 3.

This page describes the changes you need to make to a legacy Spring 2 app that uses the set of dependencies and code conventions associated with CMPSC 156 Spring/React apps.

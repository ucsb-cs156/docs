In the code bases associated with CMPSC 156, we have a standard set of Github Actions.  This pages describes each of those.  For some, there
is also advice on what to do if this job fails.

Note that while these are *mostly* standardized across the code bases, there may be minor variations.  Eventually, it may be
helpful to factor out some of these into custom actions so that there is less duplicate code to maintain.

# {{page.title}} - {{page.description}}

In the code bases associated with CMPSC 156, we have a standard set of Github Actions.  This pages describes each of those.  For some, there
is also advice on what to do if this job fails.

Note that while these are *mostly* standardized across the code bases, there may be minor variations.  Eventually, it may be
helpful to factor out some of these into custom actions so that there is less duplicate code to maintain.

## Overview

| File | Brief Description |
|-|-|
| `01-gh-pages-pr-table.yml` | Refreshes the main page from the list of PRs |
| `02-gh-pages-rebuild-part-1.yml` | Rebuilds all content for both main branch and PRs and caches it. Operates in parallel.  Stores content in cache rather than deploying to reduce contention for `gh-pages` branch. |
| `04-gh-pages-redeploy-part-2.yml` | Redeploys all content from cache; operates sequentially to reduce contention for `gh-pages` branch |
| `10-backend-unit.yml` | JUnit tests for Java backend |
| `12-backend-jacoco.yml` | Code Coverage for Java Backend |
| `13-backend-incremental-pitest.yml` | Mutation Coverage for Java backend (only on changed files) |
| `14-backend-pitest.yml` | Mutation Coverage for Java backend (on all files) |
| `15-backend-format.yml` | Formatting check on backend; Run `mvn git-code-format:format-code` from root directory to fix failures |
| `30-frontend-tests.yml` | Frontend unit tests (jest) |
| `32-frontend-coverage.yml` | Frontend code coverage (nyc) |
| `33-frontend-pr-mutation-testing.yml` | Frontend Mutation Testing (Stryker), incremental |
| `34-frontend-main-mutation-testing.yml` | Frontend Mutation Testing (Stryker), full |
| `35-frontend-format.yml` | Formatting check on frontend; Run `npm run format` from `frontend` directory to fix failures |
| `36-frontend-eslint.yml` | Linter for frontend code; Run `npx eslint --fix src` from `frontend` directory to list issues to fix |
| `40-check-production-build.yml` | Makes sure that when the backend and frontend are built with `PRODUCTION=true` that the build succeeds. |

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">
`01-gh-pages-pr-table.yml`
</summary>
Refreshes the main page from the list of PRs.

*If it fails*: Just try rerunning, especially if it fails on the Deploy step.
</details>



<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">`02-gh-pages-rebuild-part-1.yml`</summary>
Rebuilds all content for both main branch and PRs and caches it. Operates in parallel.  Stores content in cache rather than deploying to reduce contention for `gh-pages` branch.

The purpose of this job is to refresh all of the content on the github pages site in the event that the entire site needs to be rebuilt.  Accordingly, it is made up of many smaller jobs.

*If it fails*: Look for which part of it failed, and then consult the advice for the job that's closest in function to the part that failed.  For example, if it failed at the javadoc step, look at the advice about the javadoc jobs (further down on this page.)

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">
`04-gh-pages-redeploy-part-2.yml`
</summary>
Redeploys all content from cache; operates sequentially to reduce contention for `gh-pages` branch.

*If it fails*: This one fails often at the Deploy step due to contention for the `gh-pages` branch, so just re-running it often fixes the problem.

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">
`12-backend-jacoco.yml`

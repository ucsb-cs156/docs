Before you [set up your first Google OAuth application](topics/oauth/oauth_google_setup.html) or do any other actions with the Google Developer
Console, you need to **create a new project**.  This page describes how to do that.

# Steps to Create a New Project

1. Navigate to <https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager> and login with your UCSB Google Account.
   
   If you haven't already [created a Google Developer Project](/topics/oauth/google_create_google_developer_project.html), you'll need to do that first.
   
   You'll see something like this, except you might not have anything under the `UnPaid` folder.  (That is where you'll create your projecct).

2. Click the `Create Project` button (<img width="147" alt="Create Project Button" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1119017/235321614-e4e663dc-34c7-494f-8e97-ba2b3caaa6be.png">).  
   You should then see a page like this one.  
   * Fill in the name of the project with something meaningful such as the course and quarter (e.g. `cs156-s23, `cs156-m23`, etc.)  
   * The organization should be `ucsb.edu`
   * Under `Location` click `Browse` and then select `UnPaid` so that it looks like the image below

# What's next

Typical next steps are: 

* First, [Configuring the OAuth Consent Screen](/topics/oauth/google_oauth_consent_screen.html),
* Followed by [Setting up a `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` for an OAuth app](/topics/oauth/oauth_google_setup.html)

## {{page.description}}

Suppose you have a large PR that does several things:
* Introduces new backend code for an API call in `<FooController>` along with tests
* Introduces a new React component `<FooComponent>`, along with storybook entries and fixtures
* Introduces a new page in the front end `<FooPage>` that uses the `<FooController>` calls and the `<FooComponent>` to do some cool new thing in the app.

That's a lot of code to review and merge all at once. 

A better approach might be:
* PR1: just the new backend code for an API call in `<FooController>` along with tests
* PR2: just the new react component, with fixtures, storybook entry, and tests
* PR3: the page that brings it all together.

Fine. But what if you already have all three of these all in one branch? What's the easiest way to turn your one PR into three?

Here's a straightforward approach.  This should work with any PR where you:
* Have changes to many files
* But you want to create a new branch with *only* the changes to a subset of those files.

The one downside of the approach I'm going to show you here is that you lose the detailed commit history.  But often that's not a problem; in fact, it may give you the opportunity to rewrite the commit messages
so that they are actually more meaningful.  

So let's get started.  Let's assume your branch is called `AaronR-addStudentTable` and has changes to thirteen (13) files.   We want to create a new branch that only has the changes in exactly four of these files.
Those files are called:
* `frontend/src/fixtures/studentsFixtures.js`
* `frontend/src/main/components/Students/StudentsTable.js`
* `frontend/src/stories/components/Students/StudentsTable.stories.js`
* `frontend/src/tests/components/Students/StudentsTable.test.js`

In this case, we are creating a new branch that's just a new react component along with it's stories, but you could use this for any subset of the files.  
Also note that we are going to *leave the original branch unchanged* so that we have something to fall back on, and are not afraid of losing any work.  If/when we succesfully create
multiple new branches that cover all of the changes in the original branch, then we close the PR for the first one, and proceed with the three smaller ones.

### Step 1: Get a clean copy of our branch

```
git fetch origin   # update all branch pointers
git checkout AaronR-addStudentTable   #  get on our branch
git pull origin AaronR-addStudentTable  # make sure we have an up to date copy of the branch
```

### Step 2: Find the place where our branch started

Our next task is to find the sha (i.e. the hexadecimal hash code) of the commit before all of our changes started.

We can find this by looking at a PR on Github.  Navigate to the page of Github for the PR in question and find
the list of commits.  Here's what that looks like:

![find-commits](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/ucsb-cs156.github.io/assets/1119017/76a02835-b611-4e8a-890c-e6d748f96896)

You can then explore the list of commits (as shown in the animation below) until you find the one right before you started making the changes that you want to include.
In this case, we want the creation of the four files related to our `<StudentTable>` component.   We can click on each commit SHA to
figure out what code was changed in that commit.

In this case by exploring, we find that the commit right before we started making the `<StudentTable>` component was this one: `4c3524a`. We can click the button
to copy the full SHA into our copy/paste buffer.

![explore-commits](https://github.com/ucsb-cs156/ucsb-cs156.github.io/assets/1119017/607f099e-3835-468e-a837-a22ee2cfc6ec)

With that SHA ready to paste, we can move to the next step.

### Step 3: Create a new branch from this one

Next, we are going to create our new branch.  Let's call it `AaronR-StudentTable-v2`

```
git checkout -b AaronR-StudentTable-v2`
```

But we are *not* going to push this branch yet.  We need to do the surgery on this branch so that it point where we want.

### Step 4: Use `git reset --soft ...` to go back in time

Next, we use this command, pasting in the SHA from before:

```
git reset --soft 4c3524ae67f50338a16c8607fdc9244e7479bc9f
git status
```

Let's explore what happened here:
* The branch we are on, `AaronR-StudentTable2` has been reset to point to the commit `4c3524a`, the one before we started our changes.
* HOWEVER, because we used `--soft`, the files in our directory *did not change*. They still have all of our code changes in them!

So when we do a `git status` we see, in red, all of the files that we changed.

### Step 5: `git add` on *only* the files we want

Now is the magic part: we only commit the changes to the files that we want, very carefully:

```
git add frontend/src/fixtures/studentsFixtures.js
git add frontend/src/main/components/Students/StudentsTable.js
git add frontend/src/stories/components/Students/StudentsTable.stories.js
git add frontend/src/tests/components/Students/StudentsTable.test.js
```

### Step 5: `git commit... ` on *only* the files we want, and push the branch

Now we commit:

```
git commit -m "ar - create StudentTable component with fixtures, stories, and tests"
```

And now we push:

```
git push origin AaronR-StudentTable-v2
```

### Step 6: Make a new PR for this branch

You can now make a new PR for this new simplified branch, copying over the parts of the description that make sense.

### What next

If you have other branches you want to create from the other files, you can now repeat the steps for those branches.

If you just want to get back to the main branch or some other branch, you can use `git stash` to set aside all of the "red" files in your `git status`.

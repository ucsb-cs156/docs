## Why would you create a *draft PR*?

Sometimes you have a branch that you are working on that isn't quite ready to merge, but you want to get 
an idea of:
* what the diff looks like as compared to the main branch
* whether the CI/CD tests (i.e. Github Actions scripts) will pass or fail

Or, you just want to show the branch to someone on your team, or one of the course staff (LA, TA, instructor) to get
some help.

In this case a *draft PR* is a useful tool.

# How do I create a draft PR?

To create a draft PR, start exactly the same way as when creating a normal PR.  

However, in the button to create the PR, look for a drop down, and select Draft Pr instead of a regular PR, as shown in the animation:
